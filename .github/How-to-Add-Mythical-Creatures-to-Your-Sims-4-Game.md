You can find the mod on their Patreon page, where you can support them and get access to their latest updates. Alternatively, you can download the mod for free from their Tumblr page, where they post older versions of the mod.

## How to Use the Sims 4 Mythical Creatures Mod
 
The sims 4 mythical creatures mod adds a new trait called "Mythical Bloodline" to the game. This trait allows your sim to transform into a mythical creature of your choice. You can select this trait when creating a new sim or add it to an existing sim using cheats or a mod like MC Command Center.
 
Once your sim has the trait, you can choose which creature they will become by clicking on them and selecting "Nyx's Mythical Bloodline". You will see a menu with different options, such as dragon, fairy, mermaid, vampire, werewolf, etc. Each option will give you a brief description of the creature and its abilities. You can also customize the appearance of your creature form by clicking on "Change Appearance".
 
When you are ready to transform your sim into a creature, you can click on them and select "Transform". Your sim will change into their creature form and gain new interactions and abilities. For example, if your sim is a dragon, they can fly, breathe fire, collect treasures, and scare other sims. If your sim is a fairy, they can fly, cast spells, grant wishes, and play tricks on other sims. If your sim is a mermaid, they can swim faster, breathe underwater, sing enchanting songs, and communicate with sea creatures.
 
You can also transform back into your human form by clicking on your sim and selecting "Transform Back". However, some creatures have limitations on when they can transform. For example, vampires can only transform at night or in dark places. Werewolves can only transform during full moon or when they are angry.
 
The sims 4 mythical creatures mod also adds some new NPCs to the game that you can meet and interact with. You can find them in various locations depending on their type. For example, you can find fairies in parks and forests. You can find mermaids in beaches and oceans. You can find vampires in nightclubs and graveyards. You can find werewolves in rural areas and woods.
 
You can befriend these NPCs and learn more about their culture and history. You can also romance them and have hybrid children with them. However, be careful as some creatures might be hostile or dangerous to you.
