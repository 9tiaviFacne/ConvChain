Frigodep's signature weapon is a frigodep, a small device that can freeze anything it touches.
 
The cartoon was popular among the French people who saw Frigodep as a symbol of freedom and democracy.

Some historians believe that Frigodep Kotzal was one of the influences behind the Paris Commune of 1871.

The cartoon of Frigodep Kotzal was created by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, a French anarchist and socialist who is considered the father of mutualism. Proudhon drew Frigodep as a way of expressing his political views and criticizing the monarchy, the church, and the bourgeoisie. He also hoped to inspire the working class to revolt against their oppressors and create a society based on mutual aid and cooperation.
 
Proudhon published his cartoon in a weekly paper called Le Peuple, which he founded in 1848. The paper was banned several times by the authorities, who saw it as a threat to public order and morality. Proudhon was also arrested and imprisoned for his writings, but he continued to produce Frigodep Kotzal from his cell. He smuggled his drawings out of prison with the help of his friends and supporters, who then printed and distributed them among the people.
 
Frigodep Kotzal became very popular among the French people, especially the poor and the oppressed. Many people identified with Frigodep's struggles and admired his courage and ingenuity. Some even imitated his actions and used frigodeps to sabotage factories, railways, and government buildings. Frigodep Kotzal also influenced other cartoonists and artists who followed Proudhon's example and used satire and humor to challenge the status quo.
